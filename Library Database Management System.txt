1. INTRODUCTION 
Library Management System provides detailed account of the processes with two administrator?s, fifty readers and more than hundred number of books . 
The  records information about books that are available in its system. Each book is identified by a unique number BookId, title, author, an ISBN, a publisher, and a publication date.  
Each book has a single publisher and the publisher address is also recorded. 
Information about the authors of books is maintained. An author is identified by a number (AuthorId.) The name of each author is also recorded. If the Author is not in database , a new set of AuthorID, Name, Address and contact number is stored. 
The library system contains several branches, which are identified by a number (LibId). The name and the location of each branch is stored which can be updated later. Each branch of the library holds a number of copies of a particular book. Each copy of the same book kept by the same library branch is numbered from 1 to n. The total number of copies of each book in the library is needed.  
The library system keeps track of all readers who are identified by ReaderId. Each reader has a name, an address, and a phone number and a reader has to be registered in the database before borrowing a document. 
Readers have access to the online catalogue of books and may reserve books by title  if they are available. A reserved book has to be picked up before 6 pm? otherwise, the reservation is cancelled. A reader cannot borrow or reserve more than 10 books. 
Check out is defined as taking out a copy of a book on one date and time and returning it a maximum of 20 days later. RDateTime is the date and time on which the copy of checkout  book is actually returned. (RDateTime is NULL if the document has not yet been returned). Books have to be returned to the branch from which they are borrowed. 
The same copy of a book can be reserved and/or borrowed by the same reader several times. 
Books that are not returned on time are fined at a rate of 20 cents for each day after the due date. 
A copy of a book cannot be lend to more than one reader at a time, but a reader can borrow multiple copies of books.
